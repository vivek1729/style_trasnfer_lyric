556,jay z,Renegade,"(jay-z) 
 motherfuckers - 
 say that i'm foolish i only talk about jewels (bling bling) 
 do you fools listen to music or do you just skim through it? 
 see i'm influenced by the ghetto you ruined 
 that same dude you gave nothin', i made somethin' doin' 
 what i do through and through and 
 i give you the news - with a twist it's just his ghetto point-of-view 
 the renegade; you been afraid 
 i penetrate pop culture, bring 'em a lot closer to the block where they 
 pop toasters, and they live with they moms 
 got dropped roasters, from botched robberies niggaz crotched over 
 mommy's knocked up 'cause she wasn't watched over 
 knocked down by some clown when child support knocked 
 no he's not around - now how that sound to ya, jot it down 
 i bring it through the ghetto without ridin' 'round 
 hidin down duckin strays from frustrated youths stuck in they ways 
 just read a magazine that fucked up my day 
 how you rate music that thugs with nothin' relate to it? 
 i help them see they way through it - not you 
 can't step in my pants, can't walk in my shoes 
 bet everything you worth; you lose your tie and your shirt 
 (eminem) 
 since i'm in a position to talk to these kids and they listen 
 i ain't no politician but i'll kick it with 'em a minute 
 cause see they call me a menace; and if the shoe fits i'll wear it 
 but if it don't, then y'all'll swallow the truth grin and bear it 
 now who's these king of these rude ludicrous lucrative lyrics 
 who could inherit the title, put the youth in hysterics 
 usin' his music to steer it, sharin his views and his merits 
 but there's a huge interference - they're sayin' you shouldn't hear it 
 maybe it's hatred i spew, maybe it's food for the spirit 
 maybe it's beautiful music i made for you to just cherish 
 but i'm debated disputed hated and viewed in america 
 as a motherfuckin drug addict - like you didn't experiment? 
 now now, that's when you start to stare at who's in the mirror 
 and see yourself as a kid again, and you get embarrassed 
 and i got nothin' to do but make you look stupid as parents 
 you fuckin' do-gooders - too bad you couldn't do good at marriage! 
 (ha ha!) and do you have any clue what i had to do to get here i don't 
 think you do so stay tuned and keep your ears glued to the stereo 
 cause here we go - he's {*jigga joint jigga-chk-jigga*} 
 and i'm the sinister, mr. kiss-my-ass it's just the 
 (chorus: eminem + jay-z) 
 [em] renegade! never been afraid to say 
 what's on my mind at, any given time of day 
 'cause i'm a renegade! never been afraid to talk 
 about anything (anything) anything (anything), renegade! 
 [jay] never been afraid to say 
 what's on my mind at, any given time of day 
 'cause i'm a {renegade} never been afraid to holler 
 about anything {anything?} anything {anything!} 
 (jay-z) 
 i had to hustle, my back to the wall, ashy knuckles 
 pockets filled with a lot of lint, not a cent 
 gotta vent, lot of innocent of lives lost on the project bench 
 whatchu hollerin'? gotta pay rent, bring dollars in 
 by the bodega, iron under my coat, feelin' braver 
 doo-rag wrappin my waves up, pockets full of hope 
 do not step to me - i'm awkward, i box leftier often 
 my pops left me an orphan, my momma wasn't home 
 could not stress to me i wasn't grown; 'specially on nights 
 i brought somethin' home to quiet the stomach rumblings 
 my demeanor - thirty years my senior 
 my childhood didn't mean much, only raisin green up 
 raisin' my fingers to critics; raisin' my head to the sky 
 big i did it - multi before i die (nigga) 
 no lie, just know i chose my own fate 
 i drove by the fork in the road and went straight 
 (eminem) 
 see i'm a poet to some, a regular modern day shakespeare 
 jesus christ the king of these latter day saints here 
 to shatter the picture in which of that as they paint me 
 as a monger of hate and satan a scatter-brained atheist 
 but that ain't the case, see it's a matter of taste 
 we as a people decide if shady's as bad as they say he is 
 or is he the latter - a gateway to escape? 
 media scapegoat, who they can be mad at today 
 see it's easy as cake, simple as whistlin dixie 
 while i'm wavin the pistol at sixty christians against me 
 go to war with the mormons, take a bath with the catholics 
 in holy water - no wonder they try to hold me under longer 
 i'm a motherfuckin spiteful, delightful eyeful 
 the new ice cube - motherfuckers hate to like you 
 what did i do? (huh?) i'm just a kid from the gutter 
 makin' this butter off these bloodsuckers, 'cause i'm a muh'fuckin' 
 [chorus] - repeat 2x",rap
